Sudoku Game Web Application

A modern, interactive Sudoku game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features a visually appealing UI with smooth animations, real-time input handling, and a robust Sudoku validation system. Users can select difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), track their completion time, verify solutions, and generate a new randomized Sudoku puzzle for each game. The project is fully frontend-based and deployed using GitHub Pages.
